# Aesthetic-Algorithms
Independent Research Project 2017 - 2018: The Aesthetics of Computational Art

This project contains a year long research project by Taylor Baer and Chantal Danyluk 
that explored the aesthetic and artistic potential of two discrete mathematic models: 
L-systems and cellular automata.

## Purpose

The application is primarily designed to let a user run a genetic algorithm to create 
and store images created from mathematical concepts. Images can be generated 
randomly with some control features, including the ability to export a certain number of
images, at certain iterations, and control some database features.
Underneath the surface, all generated images are given a score between 0.0 - 1.0 determined
by an aesthetic metric. 

## Get Started - Cellular Automata

Users may want to visit the following link to view how to use cellular automata: https://youtu.be/MFrWTETF-lw

## Cellular Automata

To run a genetic algorithm on cellular automata, users can select the cellular automata radio
button, which changes the mode of the program. Then, users can "fetch" a new canvas, and 
"randomize the grid values" on the current grid. Alternatively, by clicking the canvas users
can place their own cells. By continually clicking "fetch" users can watch the cellular automata
grow. If users like the image, they can "export" the current image to a place on their computer.

## Cellular Automata Auto

Users can automate this process of finding a likable image through a genetic algorithm. To start,
users should hit "delete all" to clear the database of any pre-existing data. Select the cellular 
automata radio button, enter an amount of iterations, and an original export number greater than ten.
**Wait!**
When a new image appears on the screen, it is time to run the genetic algorithm. In the empty text
field labelled "Gen" enter the desired number of generations. Over ten generations and the program
will slow considerably.
**To find the images:**
In windows machines, the images will be stored in Windows(C:)\AutomataImages filepath, under a 
randomly generated file name.

## Authors

This program was developed by Taylor Baer and Chantal Danyluk, with Taylor Baer handling L-system
controls, and Chantal Danyluk developing cellular automata features.
